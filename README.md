### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Using Python's numpy and pandas libraries, we utilize descriptive statistics to filter data about Bikeshare's operations in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, based on user input for city, month, and/or day of the week. Descriptive statistics are applied to provide information about frequent travel times, popular stations and trips, trip duration, and user statistics such as type, gender, and birth year. Users may also choose to view raw data for their selected city before at the end. All functions have been timed using the time library.

### Files used
